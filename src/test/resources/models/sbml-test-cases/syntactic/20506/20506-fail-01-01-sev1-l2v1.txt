Short message    :	Invalid nesting of zero-dimensional compartments
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 2 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
The 'outside' attribute value of a <compartment> cannot be a compartment whose 'spatialDimensions' value is '0', unless both compartments have 'spatialDimensions'='0'. Simply put, a zero-dimensional compartment cannot enclose compartments that have anything other than zero dimensions themselves.
 The <compartment> with id 'c' refers to the 'outside' <compartment> 'a' which does not have 'spatialDimensions' of '0'.

Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'a' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
