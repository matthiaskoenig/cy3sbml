Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <compartment> 'c' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Line number      :	12
Package          :	
Short message    :	No units defined for 2-D compartment
Full message     :	If the attribute 'units' on a Compartment object having a 'spatialDimensions' attribute value of '2' has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with the compartment's size is determined by the value of the enclosing Model object's 'areaUnits' attribute. If neither the Compartment object's 'units' nor the enclosing Model object's 'areaUnits' attributes are set, the unit of compartment size is undefined.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	12
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
