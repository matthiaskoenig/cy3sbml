Short message    :	Invalid 'sboTerm' attribute value for a KineticLaw object
Full message     :	The value of the 'sboTerm' attribute on a <kineticLaw> is expected to be an SBO identifier (http://www.biomodels.net/SBO/) referring rate law defined in SBO (i.e., terms derived from SBO:0000001, "rate law"). 
Reference: L2V5 Sections 4.13.1 and 5
 SBO term 'SBO:0000002' on the <kineticLaw> is not in the appropriate branch.

Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.

Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <species> should set an initial value (amount or concentration) rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <species> with the id 's' does not have an 'initialSize' or 'initialAmount' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
