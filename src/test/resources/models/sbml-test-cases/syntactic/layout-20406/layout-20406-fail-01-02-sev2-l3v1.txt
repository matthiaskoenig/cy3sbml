Severity         :	Warning

Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <parameter> 'y' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	9
Package          :	
Short message    :	No units defined for the parameter
Full message     :	If the attribute 'units' on a given Parameter object has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with that parameter's value is undefined.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.7.3
 The <parameter> with id 'y' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Validation number:	80701
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	9
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare units for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'y' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Validation number:	6020406
Severity         :	Error
Line number      :	21
Package          :	layout
Short message    :	Layout 'metaidRef' must reference existing object.
Full message     :	The value of a 'layout:metaidRef' attribute of a <graphicalObject> must be of the 'metaid' of an existing element in the <model>.
Reference: L3V1 Layout V1 Section 3.7
 The <graphicalObject> with the id 'go' has a metaidRef '_Node01' which is not the metaid of any element in the model.
