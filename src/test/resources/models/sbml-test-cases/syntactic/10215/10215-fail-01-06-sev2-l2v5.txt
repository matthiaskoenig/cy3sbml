Short message    :	A <ci> element in this context must refer to a model component
Full message     :	Outside of a <functionDefinition>, if a <ci> element is not the first element within a MathML <apply>, then the <ci>'s value can only be chosen from the set of identifiers of <species>, <compartment>, <parameter>, <reaction>, or (in Level 3) <speciesReference> objects defined in the SBML model. (In L2V1, the <ci>'s value can't be chosen from the identifiers of <reaction> objects). 
Reference: L2V5 Section 3.4.3
 The formula 'gg' in the math element of the <constraint> uses 'gg' that is not the id of a species/compartment/parameter/reaction.
