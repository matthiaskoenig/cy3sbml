Short message    :	Missing unit declarations on parameters or literal numbers in expression
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression contains literal numbers or parameters whose units have not been declared, it is not possible to verify accurately the consistency of the units in the expression. 
 The units of the <initialAssignment> <math> expression 'm5 + 1 + m4' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Short message    :	Mismatched units in initial assignment to parameter
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <initialAssignment> refers to a <parameter>, the units of the <initialAssignment>'s <math> expression are expected to be consistent with the units declared for that parameter.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.8
 Expected units are mole (exponent = 5, multiplier = 0.0630957, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <initialAssignment> with symbol 'm's <math> expression are mole (exponent = 4, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
