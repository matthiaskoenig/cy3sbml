Short message    :	Missing unit declarations on parameters or literal numbers in expression
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression contains literal numbers or parameters whose units have not been declared, it is not possible to verify accurately the consistency of the units in the expression. 
 The units of the <kineticLaw> <math> expression 'S1 + 2' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Short message    :	The units of the kinetic law are not 'substance'/'time'
Full message     :	The units of the 'math' formula in a <kineticLaw> definition are expected to be the equivalent of _substance per time_.
 Expected units are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <kineticLaw>'s <math> expression (from the <reaction> with id 'reaction1') are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
