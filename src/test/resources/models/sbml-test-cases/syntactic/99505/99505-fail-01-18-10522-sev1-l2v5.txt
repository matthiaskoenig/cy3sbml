Short message    :	Missing unit declarations on parameters or literal numbers in expression
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression contains literal numbers or parameters whose units have not been declared, it is not possible to verify accurately the consistency of the units in the expression. 
 The units of the <initialAssignment> <math> expression 'p1 + p2' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	16
Package          :	
Short message    :	Mismatched units in initial assignment to species
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <initialAssignment> refers to a <species>, the units of the <initialAssignment>'s <math> expression are expected to be consistent with the units of that species' quantity.
Reference: L2V5 Section 4.11.3
 Expected units are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <initialAssignment> with symbol 'S2's <math> expression are metre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	13
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare units for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p2' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare values for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <parameter> should set an initial value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p2' does not have 'value' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
