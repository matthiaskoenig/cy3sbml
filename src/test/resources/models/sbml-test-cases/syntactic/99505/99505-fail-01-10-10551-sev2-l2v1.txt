Package          :	
Short message    :	An EventAssignment object cannot assign to a component having attribute 'constant'='true'
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 2 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
Any <compartment>, <species>, <parameter>, or (in Level 3) <speciesReference> definition whose identifier is used as the value of 'variable' in an <eventAssignment> must have a value of 'false' for its 'constant' attribute.
Reference: L2V1 Section 4.10.5
 The parameter with id 'p1' should have a constant value of 'false'.

Short message    :	Missing unit declarations on parameters or literal numbers in expression
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression contains literal numbers or parameters whose units have not been declared, it is not possible to verify accurately the consistency of the units in the expression. 
 The units of the <event> <delay> expression 'p1 + 2' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Package          :	
Short message    :	The units of the delay expression are not units of time
Full message     :	When a value for <delay> is given in a <event> definition, the units of the delay formula are expected to correspond to either the value of 'timeUnits' in the <event> or (if no 'timeUnits' are given), the model's default units of time.
 Expected units are second (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <event> with id 'event_0's <delay> are metre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
