Short message    :	Mismatched units in assignment rule for stoichiometry
Full message     :	When the value of the attribute variable in an AssignmentRule object refers to a SpeciesReference object, the unit of measurement associated with the rule's right-hand side should be consistent with the unit of stoichiometry, that is, dimensionless.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.9.3
  Expected units are dimensionless but the units returned by the <assignmentRule> with variable 'sr's <math> expression are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).

Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define an initial amount or initial concentration for every species in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <species> should set an initial value (amount or concentration) rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <species> with the id 's' does not have an 'initialSize' or 'initialAmount' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
