Short message    :	Invalid value for 'spatialSizeUnits' attribute of a one-dimensional compartment
Full message     :	If a <species> is located in a <compartment> whose 'spatialDimensions' has value '1', then that <species> definition can only set 'spatialSizeUnits' to a value of 'length', 'metre', 'dimensionless', or the identifier of a <unitDefinition> derived from 'metre' (with an 'exponent' value of '1') or 'dimensionless'.
Reference: L2V2 Section 4.8.5
 The <species> with id 's' is located in 1-D <compartment> 'c' and therefore should not have a 'spatialSizeUnits' attribute set to 'sqm'.
