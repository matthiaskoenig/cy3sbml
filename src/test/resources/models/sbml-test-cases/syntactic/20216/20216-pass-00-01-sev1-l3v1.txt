Short message    :	Invalid 'sboTerm' attribute value for a Model object
Full message     :	The value of the 'sboTerm' attribute on a <model> is expected to be an SBO identifier (http://www.biomodels.net/SBO/).  In SBML Level 2 prior to Version 4 the value is expected to be a term derived from SBO:0000004, "modeling framework"; in Version 4 and above it is expected to be a term derived from SBO:0000231 "occurring entity representation"
Reference: L3V1 Section 5
 SBO term 'SBO:0000001' on the <model> is not in the appropriate branch.

Short message    :	It's best to declare values for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <parameter> should set an initial value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p' does not have 'value' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
