Short message    :	Mismatched units in rate rule for species
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in a <rateRule> definition refers to a <species>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be of the form _x per time_, where _x_ is the units of that species' quantity, and _time_ refers to the units of time for the model.
Reference: L2V5 Section 4.11.4
  Expected units are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <rateRule> with variable 's1's <math> expression are metre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).

Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.

Short message    :	It's best to declare units for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p3' does not have a 'units' attribute.
