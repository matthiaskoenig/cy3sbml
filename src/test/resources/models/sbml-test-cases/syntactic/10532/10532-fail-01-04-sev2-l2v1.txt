Short message    :	Mismatched units in rate rule for species
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in a <rateRule> definition refers to a <species>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be of the form _x per time_, where _x_ is the units of that species' quantity, and _time_ refers to the units of time for the model.
  Expected units are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <rateRule> with variable 's1's <math> expression are metre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
