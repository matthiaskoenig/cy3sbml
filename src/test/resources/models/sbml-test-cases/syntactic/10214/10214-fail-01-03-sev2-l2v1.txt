Short message    :	A <ci> element in this context must refer to a function definition
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 2 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
Outside of a <functionDefinition>, if a <ci> element is the first element within a MathML <apply>, then the <ci>'s value can only be chosen from the set of identifiers of <functionDefinition>s defined in the SBML model.
 The formula 'X0(cell, 3)' in the math element of the <assignmentRule> with id 'z' uses 'X0' which is not a function definition id.
