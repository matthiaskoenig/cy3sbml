Short message    :	Invalid 'sboTerm' attribute value for a Species object
Full message     :	The value of the 'sboTerm' attribute on a <species> is expected to be an SBO identifier (http://www.biomodels.net/SBO/). In SBML Level 2 prior to Version 4 it is expected to refer to a participant physical type (i.e., terms derived from SBO:0000236, "participant physical type"); in Versions 4 and above it is expected to refer to a material entity (i.e., terms derived from SBO:0000240, "material entity").
Reference: L3V1 Section 5
 SBO term 'SBO:0000395' on the <species> is not in the appropriate branch.

Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <compartment> 'compartment' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Short message    :	No units defined for 3-D Compartment object
Full message     :	If the attribute 'units' on a Compartment object having a 'spatialDimensions' attribute value of '3' has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with the compartment's size is determined by the value of the enclosing Model object's 'volumeUnits' attribute. If neither the Compartment object's 'units' nor the enclosing Model object's 'volumeUnits' attributes are set, the unit of compartment size is undefined.
