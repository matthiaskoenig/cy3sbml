Package          :	
Short message    :	Invalid redefinition of built-in type name 'area'
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 1 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
Redefinitions of the built-in unit 'area' are restricted. 
 In later versions of SBML 'area' was added to the built-in units with restrictions on <unitDefinition>. Care would need be taken if this model were to be converted to a later level and version.
