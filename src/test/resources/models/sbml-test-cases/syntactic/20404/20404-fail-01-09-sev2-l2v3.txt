Short message    :	Invalid redefinition of built-in type name 'area'
Full message     :	Redefinitions of the built-in unit 'area' are restricted. 
Reference: L2V3 Section 4.4.3
 Redefinitions of the built-in unit 'area' must be based on squared 'metre's or 'dimensionless'. More formally, a <unitDefinition> for 'area' must simplify to a single <unit> in which either (a) the 'kind' attribute has a value of 'metre' and the 'exponent' attribute has a value of '2', or (b) the 'kind' attribute has a value of 'dimensionless' with any 'exponent' value.
