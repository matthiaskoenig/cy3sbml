Short message    :	Mismatched units in rate rule for compartment
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in a <rateRule> definition refers to a <compartment>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be of the form _x per time_, where _x_ is either the 'units' in that <compartment> definition, or (in the absence of explicit units declared for the compartment size) the default units for that compartment, and _time_ refers to the units of time for the model.
Reference: L2V3 Section 4.11.4
  Expected units are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <rateRule> with variable 'c's <math> expression are ampere (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
