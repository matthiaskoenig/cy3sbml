Validation id    :	99508
Validation number:	99508
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <parameter> 'p8' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Validation number:	20702
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	No units defined for the parameter
Full message     :	If the attribute 'units' on a given Parameter object has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with that parameter's value is undefined.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.7.3
 The <parameter> with id 'p8' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Validation id    :	80701
Validation number:	80701
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare units for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p8' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Validation id    :	comp-90106
Validation number:	1090106
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	1
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Line numbers unreliable.
Full message     :	Due to the need to instantiate models, modelDefinitions, submodels etc. for the purposes of validation it is problematic to reliably report line numbers when performing validation on models using the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Validation id    :	comp-20701
Validation number:	1020701
Severity         :	Error
Line number      :	14
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	The 'comp:portRef' attribute must be the 'id' of a <port>
Full message     :	The value of a 'comp:portRef' attribute on an <sBaseRef> object must be the identifier of a <port> object in the <model> referenced by that <sBaseRef>.
Reference: L3V1 Comp V1 Section 3.7.1
 The 'portRef' of the <deletion> is set to 'port1' which is not a <port> within the <model> referenced by submodel 'sub1'.
