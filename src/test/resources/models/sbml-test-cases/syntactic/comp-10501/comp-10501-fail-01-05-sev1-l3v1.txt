Validation id    :	80702
Validation number:	80702
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare values for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <parameter> should set an initial value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'param1' does not have 'value' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.

Validation number:	1090106
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	1
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Line numbers unreliable.
Full message     :	Due to the need to instantiate models, modelDefinitions, submodels etc. for the purposes of validation it is problematic to reliably report line numbers when performing validation on models using the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Validation number:	1010501
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	6
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Units of replaced elements should match replacement units.
Full message     :	If one element replaces another, whether it is the target of a <replacedBy> element, or whether it has a child <replacedElement>, the units of the replaced element, multiplied by the units of any applicable conversion factor, should equal the units of the replacement element.
Reference: L3V1 Comp V1 Section 3.6.5
 The Parameter object with units (1 metre)^1 is replaced by the Parameter object with units (1 mole)^1.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	17
Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <compartment> 'subparam1' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	17
Package          :	
Short message    :	No units defined for Compartment object
Full message     :	If neither the attribute 'units' nor the attribute 'spatialDimensions' on a Compartment object is set, the unit associated with that compartment's size is undefined.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.5
 The <compartment> 'subparam1' has no discernable units.
