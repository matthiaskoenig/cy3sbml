Validation id    :	80702
Validation number:	80702
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare values for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <parameter> should set an initial value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'param1' does not have 'value' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.

Validation number:	1090106
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	1
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Line numbers unreliable.
Full message     :	Due to the need to instantiate models, modelDefinitions, submodels etc. for the purposes of validation it is problematic to reliably report line numbers when performing validation on models using the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	7
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Units of replaced elements should match replacement units.
Full message     :	If one element replaces another, whether it is the target of a <replacedBy> element, or whether it has a child <replacedElement>, the units of the replaced element, multiplied by the units of any applicable conversion factor, should equal the units of the replacement element.
Reference: L3V1 Comp V1 Section 3.6.5
 The Parameter object with units (1 metre)^1 attempts to replace the Parameter object with units (1 metre)^1, (1 second)^-2 with an inaccurate conversionFactor declared.
