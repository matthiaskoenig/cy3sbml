Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	3
Package          :	
Short message    :	Invalid 'volumeUnits' attribute value
Full message     :	The value of the attribute 'volumeUnits' on a Model object should be either the units 'litre', 'dimensionless', or the identifier of a UnitDefinition object based on these units or a unit derived from 'metre' (with an exponent of '3').
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.2.5
 The 'volumeUnits' attribute of the <model> is 'metre_cubed', which does not comply.

Validation number:	1090106
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	1
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Line numbers unreliable.
Full message     :	Due to the need to instantiate models, modelDefinitions, submodels etc. for the purposes of validation it is problematic to reliably report line numbers when performing validation on models using the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	14
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Units of replaced elements should match replacement units.
Full message     :	If one element replaces another, whether it is the target of a <replacedBy> element, or whether it has a child <replacedElement>, the units of the replaced element, multiplied by the units of any applicable conversion factor, should equal the units of the replacement element.
Reference: L3V1 Comp V1 Section 3.6.5
 The Compartment object with units (1 metre)^1 is replaced by the Compartment object with units (1 litre)^1.

Line number      :	36
Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <species> 'S1' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Short message    :	No substance units defined for the species
Full message     :	If the attribute 'substanceUnits' in a Species object has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with the species' quantity is determined by the value of the enclosing Model object's 'substanceUnits' attribute. If neither the Species object's 'substanceUnits' attribute nor the enclosing Model object's 'substanceUnits' attribute are set, then the unit of that species' quantity is undefined.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.6.5
 The <species> with id 'S1' does not have a substanceUnits attribute, nor does its enclosing <model>.
