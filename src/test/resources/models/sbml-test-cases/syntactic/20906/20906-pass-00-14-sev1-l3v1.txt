Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: the unit of time has not been declared
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to time, the units of time should be consistent with the global time units of the model. In models where the 'timeUnits' attribute has not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to verify accurately the consistency of the units in such expressions.

Package          :	
Short message    :	Mismatched units in assignment rule for compartment
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <assignmentRule> refers to a <compartment>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be consistent with the units of that compartment's size. 
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.9.3
  Expected units are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <assignmentRule> with variable 'C's <math> expression are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).

Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define an initial amount or initial concentration for every species in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <species> should set an initial value (amount or concentration) rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <species> with the id 'S1' does not have an 'initialSize' or 'initialAmount' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.

Short message    :	It's best to declare values for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <parameter> should set an initial value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p1' does not have 'value' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
