Short message    :	Circular dependencies involving rules and reactions are not permitted
Full message     :	There must not be circular dependencies in the combined set of <initialAssignment>, <assignmentRule> and <kineticLaw> definitions in a model. Each of these constructs has the effect of assigning a value to an identifier (i.e. the identifier given in the field 'symbol' in <initialAssignment>, the field 'variable' in <assignmentRule>, and the field 'id' on the <kineticLaw>'s enclosing <reaction>). Each of these constructs computes the value using a mathematical formula. The formula for a given identifier cannot make reference to a second identifier whose own definition depends directly or indirectly on the first identifier.
Reference: L2V4 Section 4.11.5
 The AssignmentRule with id 'p' refers to that variable within the math formula 'z + p'.
