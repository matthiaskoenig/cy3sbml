Short message    :	The species' units are not consistent with units of extent
Full message     :	For every Species object produced or consumed in a reaction (that is, referenced by a SpeciesReference object), the unit of measurement of the species' substance should be consistent with the unit of extent for the model times the unit of the conversion factor for that species. More precisely, the product of the units indicated by the Model object's extentUnits and the conversionFactor attribute for that particular Species (whether the attribute is set directly on the Species object or inherited from the enclosing Model object) should be consistent with the unit specified by that Species object's substanceUnits attribute value.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.2.6
 Expected units are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the the 'extent times conversionFactor' expression are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	20
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define an initial amount or initial concentration for every species in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <species> should set an initial value (amount or concentration) rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <species> with the id 's1' does not have an 'initialSize' or 'initialAmount' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
