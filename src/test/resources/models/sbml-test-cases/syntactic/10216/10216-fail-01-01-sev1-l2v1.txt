Short message    :	Cannot use a KineticLaw local parameter outside of its local scope
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 2 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
The 'id' value of a <parameter> defined within a <kineticLaw> can only be used in <ci> elements within the MathML content of that same <kineticLaw>; the identifier is not visible to other parts of the model. 
 The <math> element of the <assignmentRule> with id 'p1' uses 'k' that is the id of a local parameter.
