Short message    :	The units of the kinetic law are not 'substance'/'time'
Full message     :	The units of the 'math' formula in a <kineticLaw> definition are expected to be the equivalent of _substance per time_.
Reference: L2V4 Section 4.13.5
 Expected units are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <kineticLaw>'s <math> expression (from the <reaction> with id 'r') are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).

Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
