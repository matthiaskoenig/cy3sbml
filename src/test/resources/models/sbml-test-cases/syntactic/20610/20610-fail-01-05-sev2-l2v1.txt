Short message    :	Cannot use a non-boundary species in both reactions and rules simultaneously
Full message     :	A <species>'s quantity cannot be determined simultaneously by both reactions and rules. More formally, if the identifier of a <species> definition having 'boundaryCondition'='false' and 'constant'='false' is referenced by a <speciesReference> anywhere in a model, then this identifier cannot also appear as the value of a 'variable' in an <assignmentRule> or a <rateRule>.
Reference: L2V1 Section 4.6.5
 The species 's' occurs in both a rule and reaction 'r'.
