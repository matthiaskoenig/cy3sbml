Short message    :	Cannot use a non-boundary species in both reactions and rules simultaneously
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 1 Version 2 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
A <species>'s quantity cannot be determined simultaneously by both reactions and rules. More formally, if the identifier of a <species> definition having 'boundaryCondition'='false' and 'constant'='false' is referenced by a <speciesReference> anywhere in a model, then this identifier cannot also appear as the value of a 'variable' in an <assignmentRule> or a <rateRule>.
 The species 's' occurs in both a rule and reaction 'r'.

Short message    :	Missing unit declarations on parameters or literal numbers in expression
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression contains literal numbers or parameters whose units have not been declared, it is not possible to verify accurately the consistency of the units in the expression. 
 The units of the <assignmentRule> <math> expression '2' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.
