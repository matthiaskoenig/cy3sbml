Short message    :	Mismatched units in event assignment for compartment
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <eventAssignment> refers to a <compartment>, the units of the <eventAssignment>'s <math> expression are expected to be consistent with the units of that compartment's size.
Reference: L2V3 Section 4.14.4
 Expected units are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <eventAssignment> with variable 'c' from the <event> with id 'e's <math> expression are ampere (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
