Short message    :	Mismatched units in event assignment for compartment
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <eventAssignment> refers to a <compartment>, the units of the <eventAssignment>'s <math> expression are expected to be consistent with the units of that compartment's size.
Reference: L2V5 Section 4.14.4
 Expected units are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <eventAssignment> with variable 'c' from the <event> with id 'e1's <math> expression are ampere (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).

Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
