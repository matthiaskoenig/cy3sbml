Package          :	
Short message    :	Invalid 'sboTerm' attribute value for a Rule object
Full message     :	The value of the 'sboTerm' attribute on a rule is expected to be an SBO identifier (http://www.biomodels.net/SBO/) referring to a mathematical expression (i.e., terms derived from SBO:0000064, "mathematical expression"). Note: This applies to Algebraic Rules in addition to Rate and Assignment Rules.
Reference: L2V5 Sections 4.11.1 and 5
 SBO term 'SBO:0000225' on the <assignmentRule> is not in the appropriate branch.

Package          :	
Short message    :	Missing unit declarations on parameters or literal numbers in expression
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression contains literal numbers or parameters whose units have not been declared, it is not possible to verify accurately the consistency of the units in the expression. 
 The units of the <assignmentRule> <math> expression 'pow(p, 3)' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	8
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare units for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	8
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare values for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <parameter> should set an initial value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p' does not have 'value' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
