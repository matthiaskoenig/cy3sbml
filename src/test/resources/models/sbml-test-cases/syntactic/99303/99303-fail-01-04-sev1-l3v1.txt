Short message    :	Units must refer to valid unit or unitDefinition
Full message     :	Where a component has an attribute that refers to a unit identifier, that attribute must refer to a unit defined in SBML or be the id of a UnitDefinition in the model.
 The subtanceUnits 'sarah' of the <species> with id 's' do not refer to a valid unit kind or the identifier of an existing <unitDefinition>.

Short message    :	Invalid value for a Species 'units' attribute
Full message     :	The value of a <species>'s 'units' attribute is restricted. 
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.6.4
 The value of a <species>'s 'substanceUnits' attribute can only be one of the following: 'mole', 'item', 'gram', 'kilogram', 'dimensionless', 'avogadro' or the identifier of a <unitDefinition> derived from 'mole' (with an 'exponent' of '1'), 'item' (with an 'exponent' of '1'), 'gram' (with an 'exponent' of '1'), 'kilogram' (with an 'exponent' of '1'), 'avogadro' (with an 'exponent' of '1') or 'dimensionless'.  The current value ('sarah') is not allowed.

Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <species> 's' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.
