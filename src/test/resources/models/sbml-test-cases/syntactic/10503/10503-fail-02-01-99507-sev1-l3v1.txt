Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: the units of reaction extent have not been declared
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to extent, the units of extent should be consistent with the global extent units of the model. In models where the 'extentUnits' attribute has not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to verify accurately the consistency of the units in such expressions.

Package          :	
Short message    :	The kinetic law's units are inconsistent with those of other kinetic laws in the model
Full message     :	The unit of measurement associated with the mathematical formula in the MathML math element of every KineticLaw object in a model should be identical to all KineticLaw objects in the model.
Reference: L3V1 Section 3.4
 The formula 's3 / k_1' in the <kineticLaw> element of the <reaction> with id 'R2' produces units that are inconsistent with units of earlier KineticLaw elements.

Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define an initial amount or initial concentration for every species in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <species> should set an initial value (amount or concentration) rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <species> with the id 's1' does not have an 'initialSize' or 'initialAmount' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
