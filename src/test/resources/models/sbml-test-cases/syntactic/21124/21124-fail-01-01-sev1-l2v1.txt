Package          :	
Short message    :	Parameters local to a KineticLaw object must have a 'constant' attribute value of 'true'
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 2 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
The 'constant' attribute on a <parameter> local to a <kineticLaw> cannot have a value other than 'true'. The values of parameters local to <kineticLaw> definitions cannot be changed, and therefore they are always constant.

Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
