Full message     :	The value of the 'sboTerm' attribute on a <model> is expected to be an SBO identifier (http://www.biomodels.net/SBO/).  In SBML Level 2 prior to Version 4 the value is expected to be a term derived from SBO:0000004, "modeling framework"; in Version 4 and above it is expected to be a term derived from SBO:0000231 "occurring entity representation"
Reference: L2V2 Section 4.2.1
 SBO term 'SBO:0000225' on the <model> is not in the appropriate branch.
