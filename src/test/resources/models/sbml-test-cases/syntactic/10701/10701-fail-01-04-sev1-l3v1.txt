Package          :	
Short message    :	Invalid 'sboTerm' attribute value for a Model object
Full message     :	The value of the 'sboTerm' attribute on a <model> is expected to be an SBO identifier (http://www.biomodels.net/SBO/).  In SBML Level 2 prior to Version 4 the value is expected to be a term derived from SBO:0000004, "modeling framework"; in Version 4 and above it is expected to be a term derived from SBO:0000231 "occurring entity representation"
Reference: L3V1 Section 5
 SBO term 'SBO:0000225' on the <model> is not in the appropriate branch.

Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <parameter> 'p' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Package          :	
Short message    :	No units defined for the parameter
Full message     :	If the attribute 'units' on a given Parameter object has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with that parameter's value is undefined.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.7.3
 The <parameter> with id 'p' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	22
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.

Short message    :	It's best to define an initial amount or initial concentration for every species in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <species> should set an initial value (amount or concentration) rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <species> with the id 's' does not have an 'initialSize' or 'initialAmount' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
