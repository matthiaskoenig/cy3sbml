Short message    :	Mismatched units in rate rule for parameter
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in a <rateRule> definition refers to a <parameter>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be of the form _x per time_, where _x_ is the 'units' in that <parameter> definition, and _time_ refers to the units of time for the model.
Reference: L3V1 Sections 4.7.3, 4.2.4 AND 4.9.4
  Expected units are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <rateRule> with variable 'p's <math> expression are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), mole (exponent = -1, multiplier = 60, scale = 0).

Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
