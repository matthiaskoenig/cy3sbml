Short message    :	Mismatched units in rate rule for parameter
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in a <rateRule> definition refers to a <parameter>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be of the form _x per time_, where _x_ is the 'units' in that <parameter> definition, and _time_ refers to the units of time for the model.
  Expected units are ampere (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), second (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <rateRule> with variable 'p's <math> expression are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
