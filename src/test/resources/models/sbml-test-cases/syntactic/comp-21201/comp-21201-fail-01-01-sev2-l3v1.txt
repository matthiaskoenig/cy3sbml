Validation id    :	99508
Validation number:	99508
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <parameter> 'param1' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Validation number:	20702
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	No units defined for the parameter
Full message     :	If the attribute 'units' on a given Parameter object has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with that parameter's value is undefined.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.7.3
 The <parameter> with id 'param1' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Validation number:	80701
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare units for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'param1' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Validation number:	80702
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare values for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <parameter> should set an initial value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'param1' does not have 'value' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.

Validation id    :	comp-90106
Validation number:	1090106
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	1
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Line numbers unreliable.
Full message     :	Due to the need to instantiate models, modelDefinitions, submodels etc. for the purposes of validation it is problematic to reliably report line numbers when performing validation on models using the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Validation id    :	comp-21201
Validation number:	1021201
Severity         :	Error
Line number      :	7
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Replaced classes must match.
Full message     :	If one element replaces another, whether it is the target of a <replacedBy> element, or whether it has a child <replacedElement>, the SBML class of the replacement element must match the SBML class of the replaced element, with two exceptions: an element of a derived class may replace an object of its base class (for base classes other than SBase), and any SBML class with mathematical meaning may replace a <parameter>. A base class may not replace a derived class, however, nor may a <parameter> replace some other SBML element with mathematical meaning.
Reference: L3V1 Comp V1 Section 3.6.5
 ReplacedElement on object with id 'param1' refers to an object of type 'Compartment' but expects an object of type 'Parameter'.
