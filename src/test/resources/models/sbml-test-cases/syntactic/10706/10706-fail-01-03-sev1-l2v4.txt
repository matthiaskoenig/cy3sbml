Short message    :	Invalid 'sboTerm' attribute value for a Constraint object
Full message     :	The value of the 'sboTerm' attribute on a <constraint> is expected to be an SBO identifier (http://www.biomodels.net/SBO/) referring to a mathematical expression (i.e., terms derived from SBO:0000064, "mathematical expression"). 
Reference: L2V4 Sections 4.12.3 and 5
 SBO term 'SBO:0000226' on the <constraint> is not in the appropriate branch.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	8
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define an initial amount or initial concentration for every species in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <species> should set an initial value (amount or concentration) rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <species> with the id 'X0' does not have an 'initialSize' or 'initialAmount' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
