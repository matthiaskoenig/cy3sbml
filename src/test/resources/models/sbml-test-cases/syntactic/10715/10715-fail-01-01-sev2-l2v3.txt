Short message    :	Invalid 'sboTerm' attribute value for a SpeciesType object
Full message     :	The value of the 'sboTerm' attribute on a <speciesType> is expected to be an SBO identifier (http://www.biomodels.net/SBO/). In SBML Level 2 prior to Version 4 it is expected to refer to a participant physical type (i.e., terms derived from SBO:0000236, "participant physical type"); in Versions 4 and above it is expected to refer to a material entity (i.e., terms derived from SBO:0000240, "material entity"). 
Reference: L2V3 Section 5
 SBO term 'SBO:0000064' on the <speciesType> is not in the appropriate branch.
