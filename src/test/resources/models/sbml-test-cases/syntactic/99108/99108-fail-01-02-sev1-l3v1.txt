Short message    :	The SBML document uses an SBML Level 3 package unavailable in this software
Full message     :	Every SBML Level 3 package is identified uniquely by an XML namespace URI and defines the attribute named 'required'. LibSBML has detected what appears to be an SBML Level 3 package with required=false but this instance of libSBML-5 cannot find the code necessary to parse this information.
 Package 'appear' is not a required package. The information relating to 'appear' will be saved but cannot be interpreted.

Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <compartment> 'c' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.
