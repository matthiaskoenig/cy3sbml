Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	11
Package          :	
Short message    :	Recursive nesting of compartments via the 'outside' attribute is not permitted
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 2 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
A <compartment> may not enclose itself through a chain of references involving the 'outside' field. This means that a compartment cannot have its own identifier as the value of 'outside', nor can it point to another compartment whose 'outside' field points directly or indirectly to the compartment.
Reference: L2V1 erratum 11
 Compartment 'a' encloses itself.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	11
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'a' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
