Severity         :	Warning

Short message    :	The units of the delay expression are not units of time
Full message     :	When a value for <delay> is given in a <event> definition, the units of the delay formula are expected to correspond to either the value of 'timeUnits' in the <event> or (if no 'timeUnits' are given), the model's default units of time.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.12.3
 Expected units are second (exponent = 1, multiplier = 360, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <event> with id 'event_0's <delay> are second (exponent = 1, multiplier = 60, scale = 0).
