Short message    :	Mismatched units in assignment rule for species
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <assignmentRule> refers to a <species>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be consistent with the units of the species' quantity.
 In a level 1 model this implies that in a <speciesConcentrationRule>, the units of the rule's right-hand side must be consistent with the units of that <species> quantity. Expected units are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <speciesConcentrationRule> with variable 's1's formula are ampere (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
