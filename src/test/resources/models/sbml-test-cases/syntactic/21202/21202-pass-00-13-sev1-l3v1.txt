Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: the unit of time has not been declared
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to time, the units of time should be consistent with the global time units of the model. In models where the 'timeUnits' attribute has not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to verify accurately the consistency of the units in such expressions.
