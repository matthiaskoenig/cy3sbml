Package          :	
Short message    :	The SBML document uses an SBML Level 3 package unavailable in this software
Full message     :	Every SBML Level 3 package is identified uniquely by an XML namespace URI and defines the attribute named 'required'. LibSBML has detected what appears to be an SBML Level 3 package with required=false but this instance of libSBML-5 cannot find the code necessary to parse this information.
 Package 'extra' is not a required package. The information relating to 'extra' will be saved but cannot be interpreted.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <parameter> 'x' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	No units defined for the parameter
Full message     :	If the attribute 'units' on a given Parameter object has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with that parameter's value is undefined.
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.7.3
 The <parameter> with id 'x' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Validation number:	80701
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare units for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'x' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Package          :	comp
Short message    :	The 'comp:idRef' attribute must be the 'id' of a model element
Full message     :	The value of a 'comp:idRef' attribute on an <sBaseRef> object must be the identifier of an object contained in (that is, within the SId namespace of) the <model> referenced by that <sBaseRef>. This includes objects with 'id' attributes defined in packages other than SBML Level 3 Core or the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	1
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Line numbers unreliable.
Full message     :	Due to the need to instantiate models, modelDefinitions, submodels etc. for the purposes of validation it is problematic to reliably report line numbers when performing validation on models using the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Short message    :	The 'comp:metaIdRef' attribute must be the 'metaid' of a model element
Full message     :	The value of a 'comp:metaIdRef' attribute on an <sBaseRef> object must be the value of a 'comp:metaid' attribute on an element contained in the <model> referenced by that <sBaseRef>.
 The 'metaidRef' of a <replacedElement> is set to 'y' which is not an element within the <model> referenced by submodel 'A'. However it may be the 'metaid' of an object within an unrecognised package.

Short message    :	Flat model not valid.
Full message     :	The interpretation the Hierarchical Model Composition constructs to produce a kind of 'flattened' version of the model devoid of the comp package constructs must produce a valid SBML Level 3 model.

 Errors that follow relate to the flattened document produced using the CompFlatteningConverter.
