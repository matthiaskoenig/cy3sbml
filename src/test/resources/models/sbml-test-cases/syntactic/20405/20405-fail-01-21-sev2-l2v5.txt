Short message    :	Invalid redefinition of built-in type name 'time'
Full message     :	Redefinitions of the built-in unit 'time' are restricted.
Reference: L2V5 Section 4.4.3
 Redefinitions of the built-in unit 'time' must be based on 'second'. More formally, a <unitDefinition> for 'time' must simplify to a single <unit> in which either (a) the 'kind' attribute has a value of 'second' and the 'exponent' attribute has a value of '1', or (b) the 'kind' attribute has a value of 'dimensionless' with any 'exponent' value.
