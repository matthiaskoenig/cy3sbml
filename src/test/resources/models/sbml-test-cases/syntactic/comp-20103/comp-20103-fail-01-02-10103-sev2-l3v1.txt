Short message    :	Document does not conform to the SBML XML schema
Full message     :	An SBML XML document must conform to the XML Schema for the corresponding SBML Level, Version and Release. The XML Schema for SBML defines the basic SBML object structure, the data types used by those objects, and the order in which the objects may appear in an SBML document.
 Attribute 'submodelRef' is not part of the definition of an SBML Level 3 Version 1 Package "comp" Version 1 on listOfReplacedElements element.

Short message    :	Allowed <listOfReplacedElements> attributes
Full message     :	A <listOfReplacedElements> object may have the optional attributes 'metaid' and 'sboTerm' defined by SBML Level 3 Core. No other attributes from the SBML Level 3 Core namespace or the HierarchicalModel Composition namespace are permitted on a <listOfReplacedElements> object.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	1
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Line numbers unreliable.
Full message     :	Due to the need to instantiate models, modelDefinitions, submodels etc. for the purposes of validation it is problematic to reliably report line numbers when performing validation on models using the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Line number      :	26
Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <compartment> 'C' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Line number      :	26
Package          :	
Short message    :	No units defined for 3-D Compartment object
Full message     :	If the attribute 'units' on a Compartment object having a 'spatialDimensions' attribute value of '3' has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with the compartment's size is determined by the value of the enclosing Model object's 'volumeUnits' attribute. If neither the Compartment object's 'units' nor the enclosing Model object's 'volumeUnits' attributes are set, the unit of compartment size is undefined.

Short message    :	No substance units defined for the species
Full message     :	If the attribute 'substanceUnits' in a Species object has not been set, then the unit of measurement associated with the species' quantity is determined by the value of the enclosing Model object's 'substanceUnits' attribute.

Reference: L3V1 Section 4.6.5
 The <species> with id 'S1' does not have a substanceUnits attribute, nor does its enclosing <model>.
