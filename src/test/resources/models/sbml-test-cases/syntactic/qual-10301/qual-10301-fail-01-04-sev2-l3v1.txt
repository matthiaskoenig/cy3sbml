Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <compartment> 'cytosol' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Short message    :	Duplicate 'id' attribute value
Full message     :	(Extends validation rule #10301 in the SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification.) Within a <model> the values of the attributes 'id' and 'qual:id' on every instance of the following classes of objects must be unique across the set of all 'id' and 'qual:id' attribute values of all such objects in a model: the <model> itself, plus all contained <functionDefinition>, <compartment>, <species>, <reaction>, <speciesReference>, <modifierSpeciesReference>, <event>, and <parameter> objects, plus the <qualitativeSpecies>, <transition>, <input> and <output> objects defined by the Qualitative Models package.
Reference: L3V1 Qual V1 Section 3.7
   The <transition> id 'tr_B' conflicts with the previously defined <transition> id 'tr_B' at line 19.
