Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	6
Package          :	
Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: encountered a model entity with no declared units
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to a compartment, species or parameter, it is necessary to know the units of the object to establish unit consistency. In models where the units of an object have not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to accurately verify the consistency of the units in mathematical expressions referring to that object. 
 The units of the <parameter> 'z' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Package          :	
Short message    :	Missing unit declarations on parameters or literal numbers in expression
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression contains literal numbers or parameters whose units have not been declared, it is not possible to verify accurately the consistency of the units in the expression. 
 The units of the <initialAssignment> <math> expression '34 * i' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	6
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare units for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'z' does not have a 'units' attribute.

Short message    :	Line numbers unreliable.
Full message     :	Due to the need to instantiate models, modelDefinitions, submodels etc. for the purposes of validation it is problematic to reliably report line numbers when performing validation on models using the Hierarchical Model Composition package.
