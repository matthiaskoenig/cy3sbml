Short message    :	Only one <math> element is allowed in a KineticLaw object
Full message     :	An SBML XML document must conform to the XML Schema for the corresponding SBML Level, Version and Release. The XML Schema for SBML defines the basic SBML object structure, the data types used by those objects, and the order in which the objects may appear in an SBML document. A KineticLaw object must contain exactly one MathML <math> element.  The <math> element is optional in L3V2 and beyond.
 In <reaction> with id 'r' the <kineticLaw> contains no <math> element.
