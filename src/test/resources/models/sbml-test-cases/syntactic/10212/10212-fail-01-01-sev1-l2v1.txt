Short message    :	Terms in a <piecewise> expression must have consistent data types
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 2 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
The types of values within <piecewise> operators must all be consistent: the set of expressions that make up the first arguments of the <piece> and <otherwise> operators within the same <piecewise> operator should all return values of the same type.
 The piecewise formula in the math element of the <algebraicRule> returns arguments which have different value types from the first element 'p * 6'.
