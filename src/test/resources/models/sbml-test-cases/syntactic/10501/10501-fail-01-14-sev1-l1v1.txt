Short message    :	The units of the function call's arguments are not consistent with its definition
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 1 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
The units of the expressions used as arguments to a function call are expected to match the units expected for the arguments of that function. 
 The formula 'c - s' in the math element of the <parameterRule>  with id 'p' can only act on variables with the same units.

Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare units for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p' does not have a 'units' attribute.
