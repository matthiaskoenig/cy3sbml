Short message    :	The units of the function call's arguments are not consistent with its definition
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 1 Version 2 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
The units of the expressions used as arguments to a function call are expected to match the units expected for the arguments of that function. 
 The formula 'p + p1' in the math element of the <algebraicRule> can only act on variables with the same units.
