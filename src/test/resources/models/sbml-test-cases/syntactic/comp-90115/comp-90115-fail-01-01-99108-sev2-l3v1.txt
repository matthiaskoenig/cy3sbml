Validation id    :	99108
Validation number:	99108
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	2
Package          :	
Short message    :	The SBML document uses an SBML Level 3 package unavailable in this software
Full message     :	Every SBML Level 3 package is identified uniquely by an XML namespace URI and defines the attribute named 'required'. LibSBML has detected what appears to be an SBML Level 3 package with required=false but this instance of libSBML-5 cannot find the code necessary to parse this information.
 Package 'extra' is not a required package. The information relating to 'extra' will be saved but cannot be interpreted.

Validation id    :	comp-90106
Validation number:	1090106
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	1
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Line numbers unreliable.
Full message     :	Due to the need to instantiate models, modelDefinitions, submodels etc. for the purposes of validation it is problematic to reliably report line numbers when performing validation on models using the Hierarchical Model Composition package.

Validation id    :	comp-90115
Validation number:	1090115
Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	8
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	The 'comp:idRef' attribute must be the 'id' of a model element
Full message     :	The value of a 'comp:idRef' attribute on an <sBaseRef> object must be the identifier of an object contained in (that is, within the SId namespace of) the <model> referenced by that <sBaseRef>. This includes objects with 'id' attributes defined in packages other than SBML Level 3 Core or the Hierarchical Model Composition package.
 The 'idRef' of a <port> is set to 'y' which is not an element within the <model>. However it may be an identifier of an object within an unrecognised package.

Validation number:	1090105
Severity         :	Error
Line number      :	1
Package          :	comp
Short message    :	Flat model not valid.
Full message     :	The interpretation the Hierarchical Model Composition constructs to produce a kind of 'flattened' version of the model devoid of the comp package constructs must produce a valid SBML Level 3 model.
Reference: L3V1 Comp V1 Appendix A1
 Errors that follow relate to the flattened document produced using the CompFlatteningConverter.
