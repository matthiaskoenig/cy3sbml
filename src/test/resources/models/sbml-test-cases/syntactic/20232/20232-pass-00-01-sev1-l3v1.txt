Short message    :	Unable to verify consistency of units: the unit of time has not been declared
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression refers to time, the units of time should be consistent with the global time units of the model. In models where the 'timeUnits' attribute has not been declared, libSBML does not yet have the functionality to verify accurately the consistency of the units in such expressions.

Package          :	
Short message    :	Missing unit declarations on parameters or literal numbers in expression
Full message     :	In situations where a mathematical expression contains literal numbers or parameters whose units have not been declared, it is not possible to verify accurately the consistency of the units in the expression. 
 The units of the <eventAssignment> <math> expression '1 + 2' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare values for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <parameter> should set an initial value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p' does not have 'value' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
