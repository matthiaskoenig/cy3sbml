Package          :	
Short message    :	Invalid 'sboTerm' attribute value for a Reaction object
Full message     :	The value of the 'sboTerm' attribute on a <reaction> is expected to be an SBO identifier (http://www.biomodels.net/SBO/) referring to an occurring entity representation defined in SBO (i.e., terms derived from SBO:0000231, "occurring entity representation"). 
Reference: L3V1 Section 5
 SBO term 'SBO:0000064' on the <reaction> is not in the appropriate branch.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	22
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.

Short message    :	It's best to define an initial amount or initial concentration for every species in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <species> should set an initial value (amount or concentration) rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <species> with the id 's' does not have an 'initialSize' or 'initialAmount' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
