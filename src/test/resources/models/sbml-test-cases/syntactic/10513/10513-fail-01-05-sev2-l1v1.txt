Short message    :	Mismatched units in assignment rule for parameter
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <assignmentRule> refers to a <parameter>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be consistent with the units declared for that parameter. 
 In a level 1 model this implies that in a <parameterRule>, the units of the rule's right-hand side must be consistent with the units declared for that <parameter>. Expected units are volt (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <parameterRule> with variable 'p's formula are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
