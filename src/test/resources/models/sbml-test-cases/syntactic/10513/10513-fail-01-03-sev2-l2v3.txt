Short message    :	Mismatched units in assignment rule for parameter
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <assignmentRule> refers to a <parameter>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be consistent with the units declared for that parameter. 
Reference: L2V3 Section 4.11.3
  Expected units are ampere (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <assignmentRule> with variable 'p's <math> expression are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
