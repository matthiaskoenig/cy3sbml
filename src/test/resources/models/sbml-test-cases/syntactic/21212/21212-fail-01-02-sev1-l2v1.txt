Package          :	
Short message    :	An EventAssignment object cannot assign to a component having attribute 'constant'='true'
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 2 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
Any <compartment>, <species>, <parameter>, or (in Level 3) <speciesReference> definition whose identifier is used as the value of 'variable' in an <eventAssignment> must have a value of 'false' for its 'constant' attribute.
Reference: L2V1 Section 4.10.5
 The species with id 's' should have a constant value of 'false'.

Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	11
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.

Short message    :	It's best to define an initial amount or initial concentration for every species in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <species> should set an initial value (amount or concentration) rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <species> with the id 's' does not have an 'initialSize' or 'initialAmount' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
