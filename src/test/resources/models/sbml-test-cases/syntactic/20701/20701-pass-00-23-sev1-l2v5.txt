Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	5
Package          :	
Short message    :	It's best to declare values for every parameter in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the <parameter> should set an initial value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <parameter> with the id 'p1' does not have 'value' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
