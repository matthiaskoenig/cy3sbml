Short message    :	Mismatched units in initial assignment to species
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <initialAssignment> refers to a <species>, the units of the <initialAssignment>'s <math> expression are expected to be consistent with the units of that species' quantity.
Reference: L2V3 Section 4.11.3
 Expected units are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <initialAssignment> with symbol 's1's <math> expression are ampere (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
