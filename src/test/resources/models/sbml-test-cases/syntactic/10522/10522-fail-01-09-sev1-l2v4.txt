Short message    :	Mismatched units in initial assignment to species
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <initialAssignment> refers to a <species>, the units of the <initialAssignment>'s <math> expression are expected to be consistent with the units of that species' quantity.
Reference: L2V4 Section 4.11.3
 Expected units are mole (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <initialAssignment> with symbol 's1's <math> expression are ampere (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0), litre (exponent = -1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).

Short message    :	It's best to define a size for every compartment in a model
Full message     :	As a principle of best modeling practice, the size of a <compartment> should be set to a value rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the portability of models between different simulation and analysis systems, and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.
 The <compartment> with the id 'c' does not have a 'size' attribute, nor is its initial value set by an <initialAssignment> or <assignmentRule>.
