Short message    :	Mismatched units in assignment rule for compartment
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <assignmentRule> refers to a <compartment>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be consistent with the units of that compartment's size. 
Reference: L2V4 Section 4.11.3
  Expected units are metre (exponent = 2, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <assignmentRule> with variable 'c's <math> expression are volt (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
