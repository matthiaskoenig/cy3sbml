Short message    :	Mismatched units in assignment rule for compartment
Full message     :	When the 'variable' in an <assignmentRule> refers to a <compartment>, the units of the rule's right-hand side are expected to be consistent with the units of that compartment's size. 
 In a level 1 model this implies that in a <compartmentVolumeRule>, the units of the rule's right-hand side must be consistent with the units of that <compartment>'s volume. Expected units are litre (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0) but the units returned by the <compartmentVolumeRule> with variable 'c's formula are ampere (exponent = 1, multiplier = 1, scale = 0).
