Severity         :	Warning
Line number      :	6
Package          :	
Short message    :	Invalid redefinition of built-in type 'length'
Full message     :	[Although SBML Level 1 Version 1 does not explicitly define the following as an error, other Levels and/or Versions of SBML do.] 
Redefinitions of the built-in unit 'length' are restricted.
 In later versions of SBML 'length' was added to the built-in units with restrictions on <unitDefinition>. Care would need be taken if this model were to be converted to a later Level and Version.
