# cy3sbml API
The following functionality will be available via the API via commands
and services:

* `SBML` : definition of constants
* `SBMLManager` : access to the SBMLDocuments and Network to SBML mappings
* `SBMLReaderTask` : reading SBML models in cytoscape

The respective API must still be implemented.
